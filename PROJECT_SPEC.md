# Metrology Assurance Suite

## Project Goal

Metrology Assurance Suite is a local HTTP service that keeps a traceable record
of laboratory measurement assurance work. It registers devices, opens a
verification case for one device, records technician measurements, requests a
repeat measurement when tolerance is exceeded, and seals the final evidence
record after review.

The service is intentionally self-contained. It uses an in-memory repository
with atomic copy-on-write mutations and does not require a database or an
external service.

## Users

- Laboratory steward: registers devices and opens verification cases.
- Measurement technician: records observed values for an open case.
- Quality verifier: reviews accepted measurements and seals the case.

## Core Entities

- Device: a laboratory asset with a unique asset tag, model, room, steward, and
  lifecycle state.
- VerificationCase: one bounded assurance activity for a device, with a nominal
  value, tolerance, current state, version, and assigned steward.
- Measurement: an observed value, computed deviation, acceptance decision,
  technician, and timestamp.
- EvidenceSeal: the immutable closing record for a reviewed case, including the
  selected accepted measurement.
- AuditEvent: an append-only trace of meaningful case and device changes.
- CaseTransition: one effective case state transition with a case-scoped,
  gap-free sequence, the business state and version before and after the
  transition, the acting operator, the action-specific basis (measurement,
  reopen reason, or seal), and a link to its audit event.

## Workflows

### 1. Register Device

The steward sends `POST /devices` with an asset tag, model, room, and steward.
The service validates the request, normalizes the asset tag, rejects duplicate
tags, and creates an active device.

### 2. Open Verification Case

The steward sends `POST /cases` with a device ID, nominal value, tolerance, and
owner. The service verifies that the device exists, is active, and has no
unfinished case. A valid request creates a case in `awaiting_measurement`.

### 3. Record Measurement

A technician sends `POST /cases/{id}/measurements`. The case must be
`awaiting_measurement`. The service computes the signed deviation from the
nominal value. An in-tolerance measurement moves the case to
`review_ready`; an out-of-tolerance measurement moves it to
`recheck_required`.

### 4. Reopen Verification Case

The steward sends `POST /cases/{id}/reopen` after an out-of-tolerance result.
Only `recheck_required` cases may move back to `awaiting_measurement`. The
service records the actor and reason in the audit trail.

### 5. Seal Verification

The verifier sends `POST /cases/{id}/seal` after an accepted measurement. Only
`review_ready` cases may be sealed. The service selects the accepted
measurement with the smallest absolute deviation, creates exactly one evidence
seal, moves the case to `sealed`, and rejects later mutations.

## State And Rules

Device state:

- `active -> retired`
- `retired` is terminal.

VerificationCase state:

- `awaiting_measurement -> review_ready`
- `awaiting_measurement -> recheck_required`
- `recheck_required -> awaiting_measurement`
- `review_ready -> sealed`
- `sealed` is terminal.

Required invariants:

- Asset tags are unique after case-insensitive normalization.
- A device has at most one unfinished verification case.
- Measurements are accepted only while a case is awaiting measurement.
- A tolerance must be positive.
- A case can have at most one evidence seal.
- A sealed case cannot accept measurements, reopen, or seal again.
- Every mutation that changes a case also appends an audit event and a case
  transition in the same repository commit.
- Only a committed transition exists: a failed or rolled-back request appends
  neither an event nor a step and leaves no sequence gap.
- Transitions are ordered solely by their case-scoped sequence (1, 2, 3, ...),
  which is gap-free, so later events never rearrange earlier history.
- Each transition records the source and target business state and version;
  consecutive steps link target-to-source and the final step must equal the
  stored case state and version. The read side verifies this chain before
  serving the timeline.
- The case detail and the events endpoints build the timeline through one
  shared function, so both entry points always describe the same facts.

## Modules

- `cmd/metrology-service`: process entrypoint and graceful HTTP shutdown.
- `cmd/workflowcheck`: bounded smoke checks that call the public HTTP API.
- `internal/httpapi`: routing, request decoding, and stable error mapping.
- `internal/assurance`: workflow orchestration and atomic decisions.
- `internal/domain`: entities, validation, state transitions, and errors.
- `internal/repository`: mutex-protected in-memory persistence with copy-on-write
  commits.
- `internal/contracts`: request and response contracts shared by the HTTP layer.

## Public Interfaces

- `GET /healthz`
- `POST /devices`
- `GET /devices/{id}`
- `POST /cases`
- `GET /cases/{id}`
- `POST /cases/{id}/measurements`
- `POST /cases/{id}/reopen`
- `POST /cases/{id}/seal`
- `GET /cases/{id}/events`

## Validation Plan

The baseline build command is `go build ./...`. Each declared workflow has a
bounded production smoke command under `cmd/workflowcheck`. The command starts
an HTTP test server in the same process, calls the public routes, and verifies
both success and failure behavior. The seal check also races two concurrent
seal requests to prove that the repository mutation lock permits exactly one
seal.

The engineering task stage adds unit and integration tests under `go test
./...`, covering the state machine, timeline chain verification (gaps, broken
links, head mismatch), copy-on-write rollback that discards steps and
sequence numbers, failed requests producing no steps, later events never
rearranging earlier steps, concurrent seals producing exactly one timeline
step, and identical timeline output across the case and events entry points.
